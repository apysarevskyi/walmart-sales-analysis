# Walmart Sales Analysis

This repository contains an in-depth analysis of Walmart sales data, focusing on identifying trends, seasonality, and factors affecting sales performance. The dataset used for this analysis can be found here: [Kaggle - Walmart Sales Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mikhail1681/walmart-sales).

## Key aspects of this project include:

* Analyzing the impact of holidays on sales.
* Investigating relationships between sales and factors like temperature, fuel prices, CPI, and unemployment rates.
* Visualizing sales trends over time and across multiple stores.
* Applying statistical methods to understand correlations and make predictions.

The analysis is also available on Kaggle: [Walmart Sales Analysis Notebook](https://www.kaggle.com/code/andriipysarevskyi/walmart-sales).
